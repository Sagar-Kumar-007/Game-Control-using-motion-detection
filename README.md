# Game-Control-using-motion-detection
Controlling endless runners using our motion may be a dream to many. I made this code using OpenCV which detects the body motion such as jump, roll and moving sideways and incorporates it into
the game. Games like Subway Surfers, Despicable Me: Minion Rush can be played using this code. While writing the code, I came to know about the direct keys and the Virtual keys.
Games take input using Direct Keys and not Virtual Keys, so I took help of a stackoverflow answer on [direct-keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489013/simulate-python-keypresses-for-controlling-a-game)
